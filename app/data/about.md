#### Intro
I am a Full Stack developer with expereience in early-stage startups, UX and UI design, entrepreneurship, and team leadership consulting. I am passionate about building products that make processes (and life!) easier :).


<br>
I am available to consult on interesting projects. I am particularly interested in social impact, education, inclusivity, and space. I enjoy advising companies and may even be available for pro-bono work depending on the time commitment and the project. If you would like to arrange a meeting, I am based in Sofia but travel to the Aarhus Area frequently.

#### Currently
At Codaisseur I have learned how to build teams and manage people, build relationships with customers, sell enterprise products, and build on-line predictive models for production environments. I've also learned how to build and maintain large web applications.

#### Some History

- My parents did not put a computer in my bedroom until 2006 when I was 18. It was a modern HP notebook that ran Windows 7. My favorite thing was editing videos on Windows Movie Maker. It had a fingerprint reader and a turbo button. To this day, I still don't know what pressing the turbo button really did.

- At 10, I discovered the Super Mario Bros. game and I loved it ever since.

- At 12, my parents bought a camera. It could fit 10 images to a floppy disk at a 0.3MP resolution. I still have it and it still works. I've been taking photographs ever since, now with a Nikon D750, D800, and occasionally with a Canon EOS 6D.

- At 15, I built my first website with Microsoft FrontPage. My website was terrible.

- At 16, I participated in a foreign exchange program in Orneta, Poland. Since then, I've gone back almost every year.

- At 19, I took my first graduate course and published my first academic paper.

- At 20, I went to European Voluntary Service and fell in love. I went back two more times and promised myself that I'd speak Italian. I've since spoken fluent Italian.
